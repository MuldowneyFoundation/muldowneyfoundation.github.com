        <p>Like many other charitable endeavors, the Muldowney Foundation has sprung from the experiences of a single family that was thrust into unforeseen, wrenching circumstances. In this instance, one of the founding family members was the victim of a severe automobile accident. Surviving the accident was miraculous, but a traumatic brain injury was one of the many and perhaps most severe of the injuries to be confronted on the long road to recovery.</p>

<p>Part of the treatment process involved time at a summer camp for brain injury victims. Empty beds at the camp indicated the possibility of including more individuals who would benefit from time at the camp. But the issue was not a lack of possible attendees, as there were many in similar circumstances who sought to send a family member for the therapeutic summer sessions. Instead, the problem was funding and affordability. So, with the simple observation that 'We should do something about that', the Muldowney Foundation was begun.</p>

<h3>Charitable Purpose</h3>

<p>The Muldowney Foundation is committed to the following goals and principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promoting public awareness for the need for support of people with Brain Injuries and Disabilities.</li>
<li>Assisting people with Brain Disorders and their families to lead normal lives.</li>
<li>Working with other Mental Health agencies to actively promote parity for persons with Mental Disabilities.</li>
<li>Using resources available to the Foundation to provide access to therapeutic activities for people with Mental Health related disabilities.</li>
<li>Providing both financial and social assistance to people with Mental Health related disabilities and their families.</li>
<li>Helping guide families through the process of requesting assistance from appropriate Federal, State, and Local agencies.</li>
</ul><h3>Activities</h3>

<p>The following are some highlights of the activities in which the Muldowney Foundation has been involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Muldowney Foundation in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.silverribbon.org/">Silver Ribbon Coalition</a> gathered and submitted over 60,000 letters to the Postmaster General, petitioning for a Silver Ribbon Postage stamp for Mental Health Awareness. The request is currently under consideration.</li>
<li>The Muldowney Foundation has met with various Government leaders at both the local and national level to promote Mental Health parity and awareness.</li>
<li>The Muldowney Foundation is working with the State of Illinois for the issuance of a Silver Ribbon license plate. Proceeds from the plate will be directed towards Mental Health.</li>
<li>The Muldowney Foundation is working with private organizations to bring much-needed, adequate housing to Illinois for Brain Injured persons.</li>
</ul><h3>Technology Goals</h3>

<p>Most recently, the Foundation has added some decidedly high tech development efforts to its activities. The goals and principles remain very much the same, but the means to those ends are the application of the latest development approaches and leading edge technologies. A coalition of leading medical practitioners and technologists are collaborating to identify, prioritize and develop readily accessible, user-friendly applications to help address the everyday challenges of those with Brain Injuries and Disabilities.</p>

<p>The technical build and delivery is driven by a group of volunteer technologists employing an open source, collaborative development approach to craft the prioritized applications. The first of the developers came from one of the country's leading computer science programs at the University of Illinois in Urbana/Champaign. A core principle is making the apps as broadly and economically available as possible. To that end, the applications will be made available via the 'cloud', relying on the hosting services made available by Google and leveraging the Google Apps tool suite.</p>

<h3>Foundation Funding</h3>

<p>The Muldowney Foundation is a non-profit organization registered to the state of Illinois and exempt from federal income tax under section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation relies entirely on funding from private sources and donated labor. This is accomplished through various fund raising activities such as the annual golf outing, that are themselves supported entirely by volunteer labor. Donors are both individuals and corporate, and have been generous in their assistance.</p>
